# Inter Process Communication (IPC) Benchmarking

A comparative analysis of IPC methods for embedded applications.

In this study, a series of state-of-the-art IPC methods are considered for this comparative analysis,

- ZeroMQ
- Unix socket
- Pipes
- Message Queues
- FIFOs (named pipes)
- Shared Memory
- Memory-mapped Files

## Experiment

Communication Duration (Minimum, Maximum, and Average duration)
Message rate

For the experiments, all metrics are calculated for various messages size.
Also, the trend of the metrics for different message size needs to be monitored.
